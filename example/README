====================
Minimization Example
====================

The .prm and .rtf files are needed to run simulations of azido or akynyl
small molecules, functional group, or unnatural amino acids. 

In general, these parameters can be used as described in CHARMM documentation.
CHARMM is constructed so that new functionality can be added by simply
reading new .prm and .rtf files with new functional groups. Below are more
specific instructions.

In this example, a protein with an uAA pAz mutation (PDB ID: 5xhf) will be
minimized for 500 SD steps. Appropriate protein, CGenFF, and new azido and
alkynyl parameters will be applied to the novel functional groups 
introduced by the uAA mutation.

1. Obtain CHARMM simulation code and executable.
2. Obtain the new azide and alkyne topology and parameter files.
3. The minimize.inp script includes example read topology and parameter 
   commands for the new azide and alkyne topology and parameter files.
4. Run CHARMM simulation by typing 
   charmm < minimize.inp > minimize.out
5. Outputs will be recorded in the minimize.out file. New .pdb, .psf, and .crd
   files will also be written to record the changes in protein structure.
